Integration Steps with SIEM
To integrate Google Cloud Pub/Sub with your SIEM:

Create a Service Account

Create a service account that will allow your SIEM system to access the Pub/Sub topic.
Grant the roles/pubsub.subscriber role to the service account for the Pub/Sub topic.

Terraform example:

hcl
Copy code
resource "google_service_account" "siem_service_account" {
  account_id   = "siem-integration"
  display_name = "SIEM Integration Service Account"
}

resource "google_pubsub_subscription" "siem_subscription" {
  name  = "siem-subscription"
  topic = google_pubsub_topic.security_notifications.id

  push_config {
    push_endpoint = var.siem_push_endpoint
    oidc_token {
      service_account_email = google_service_account.siem_service_account.email
    }
  }
}

resource "google_project_iam_member" "siem_pubsub_access" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/pubsub.subscriber"
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.siem_service_account.email}"
}
Configure SIEM to Subscribe to the Pub/Sub Topic

Use the SIEMâ€™s documentation to configure it to subscribe to the Pub/Sub topic using the service account credentials.
For pull-based ingestion, configure the SIEM to poll messages from the subscription.
Test Integration

Generate test findings in Security Command Center.
Verify that the SIEM receives and processes the messages.
Monitor and Troubleshoot

Enable and review audit logs for Pub/Sub and Security Command Center for debugging issues.
Set up monitoring and alerts for errors in Pub/Sub message delivery.
